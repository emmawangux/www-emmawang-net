                  Before the redesign, LingoLeap's sign up flow was confusing
                  and caused high drop-offs. After implementing key UX
                  improvements, sign up completion rates increased by 64%.

              <p>
                I joined LingoLeap in August 2024, stepping into a fast-paced
                startup environment. With no structured onboarding, I jumped
                right in with my laptop and started getting up-to-speed on the
                product.
              </p>
              <p>
                To get familiar, I started where any new user would: signing up.
                That's when I noticed friction. The process wasn't broken, but
                it felt‚Ä¶ clunky. A few small friction points here, an unexpected
                dead end there. If I am stuck here and there, what were users
                experiencing? To confirm my observations, I checked the data. It
                showed that 79.7% of users abandoned the process after clicking
                "Register."
              </p>
              <p>
                Sign up and Login aren't just user experience touchpoints, they
                are like the front door to a product. If users struggle to open
                it, they may turn away before even stepping inside. A smooth
                entry experience directly impacts user acquisition. I documented
                the issues and compiled a recommendation report outlining what
                was happening and how we could improve it. After reviewing it,
                my PM came back with: üí¨ "Let's fix it."

                The 4 Core Issues in the Sign Up Flow

                  1. Unnecessary Detours and Defaulting to Phone Instead of
                  Email</span
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                PROBLEM: New users were forced to navigate an unnecessary
                detour. Both the "Login / Sign Up" and ‚ÄúStart Free Practice
                Test‚Äù buttons on the homepage led to the login page, requiring
                users to manually find and click "Sign Up" to begin the process.
                Additionally, the default sign up method was set to phone
                number, even though data showed that most users preferred email.
                This added extra steps and confusion.
              </p>
              <p>
                IMPACT: This created friction for new users, delaying their
                ability to start using the platform and potentially increasing
                bounce rates.

              </p>

              <p>
                PROBLEM: The system displayed error messages like ‚ÄúBad email
                format‚Äù (even when the email was correct) and ‚ÄúEmail can't be
                empty‚Äù (even when the field was filled). These messages appeared
                as toast notifications that disappeared after 3 seconds, forcing
                users to read and remember them quickly.
              </p>
              <p>
                IMPACT: Confusing and fleeting error messages eroded user
                confidence, making the system appear unreliable. Poor visual
                feedback further frustrated users during a critical moment in
                their journey.

              </p>

              <p>
                PROBLEM: The password reset flow required users to enter their
                old password to reset it, which defeated the purpose of a
                password reset. If users forgot their password, they were unable
                to complete the process, leaving them stuck.

                IMPACT: This created a dead end for users who needed help,

              <p>
                PROBLEM: The UI had several inconsistencies and usability

              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Phone number and email tabs looked like labels, not
                  interactive buttons.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Inconsistent terminology: Some labels said "Register," while
                  others said "Sign Up," with varying uppercase and lowercase
                  styles.
                </li>
                <li>Lack of clear visual feedback for active input fields.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                IMPACT: These inconsistencies confused users, making the
                interface feel unpolished and difficult to navigate.

              <p>
                The sign up flow had usability issues that created friction,
                leading to drop-offs and poor first impressions. In addressing
                these problems, the goal was to streamline the process, reduce
                cognitive load, and improve the user experience. Below is a
                recap of 4 key issues.
              </p>

              <h3 class="heading-with-line">Design Direction</h3>
              <p>
                To improve the sign up flow, I explored two design directions.
                Version A grouped phone and Google sign up under "or" to reduce
                cognitive load for email users, while Version B retained the
                original top tabs for phone and email sign up, defaulting to
                email for alignment with user preferences.
              </p>
              <p>
                After evaluating user needs and stakeholder constraints, Version
                B was selected as the final solution. It accommodated users who
                prefer phone sign up and minimized changes to the codebase.
              </p>

              <div class="design-note">

              <p>
                Once Version B was selected, I shifted my focus to refining the
                flow and layout to ensure the sign up process was intuitive,
                efficient, and aligned with the new brand guidelines. To address
                the core issues, I implemented the following solutions:

              <p>
                First, I redesigned the landing page to make it easier for new
                users to get started. I added two clear buttons: "Login" for
                returning users and "Get Started" to encourage new users. This
                not only made the process simpler and more inviting but also
                gave us better data on how people were using the platform. I
                also kept the "Start free practice test" button front and center
                to nudge new users toward signing up.

              <p>
                Set email as the default sign up option since most users prefer
                it, but kept the phone option easily accessible for those who
                need it. This small change cut out extra steps, made things
                faster.

                  This outcome underscores the value of industry best practices.
                  Even though sign up processes are standard, they require
                  careful consideration of user habits and data analysis to
                  guide design choices. Imagine offering a free sample, but the
                  door is jammed. How likely are users to come back? For a B2C
                  platform, attracting and onboarding new users is critical to
                  success. By focusing on user habits and data insights, we
                  ensured the sign up process was clear, intuitive, and
                  welcoming.
