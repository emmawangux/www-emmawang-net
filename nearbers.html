            with their neighbors in the same apartment or condo complex. It was created during the COVID-19 lockdown to
            address the challenge of limited neighbor connections. With NearBers, users can discover and interact with
            their neighbors, participate in community events, and share information and resources.</p>

          <p class="general-paragraph">NearBers was my first UX project where I aimed to challenge myself and learn

          Step into the bustling world of urban cities, where apartment life can be strangely isolating. In major
          cities like London and New York, a significant percentage of residents—55% and 52% respectively—admit to
          feeling lonely in their own urban environments, as revealed by a TimeOut City Index survey.

        <p class="general-paragraph">
          In fact, many of us don't even know the names of our neighbors, despite crossing paths with them day after
          day. Living in the same community, we purposefully avoid chance encounters with our neighbors. Even within
          the confined space of an elevator, our interactions are reduced to fleeting glances, leaving conversations
          unspoken.

            NearBers lets users see neighbors' hobbies and interests on their profiles. This helps them find like-minded
            neighbors and start conversations easily. Users can use preferred names, not real names, and room numbers
            are kept private for security.

              NearBers is a project that aims to revolutionize the way we experience apartment living. With
              NearBers,
              users can seek help, share information, and build a small but supportive community. Neighbors become
              friends in your urban journey. Although I haven't conducted formal usability tests, I will get a
              chance
              to test the app, gather feedback, and make necessary improvements.

            <h3 class="padding-gap-top-24 heading-tertiary">Learning By Doing</h3>
            <p class="general-paragraph">
              One of the key takeaways from this experience was the importance of learning by doing. Theory alone
              is
              not enough, and taking action is crucial for learning and growth. Throughout the project, from the
              initial stages to the final design, I had the experience to apply my knowledge in a practical
              setting.
              This hands-on experience also allowed me to become more comfortable and proficient in using Figma.

            <h3 class="padding-gap-top-24 heading-tertiary">Focused On One Feature</h3>
            <p class="general-paragraph">
              In the project, my main focus was on developing a feature that aimed to break through the walls and
              encourage interactions among apartment or condo dwellers. After completing the design, I shared it with a
              few friends, one mentioned, "This app is a game-changer! No more wall-pounding when dealing with loud
              neighbors late at night!" This feedback emphasized how the feature addressed common issues and
              significantly improved the overall living experience for apartment or condo dwellers.
