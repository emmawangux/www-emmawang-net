    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <div class="spacer2"></div>
    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>
        Nearbers is a social networking app.
        Nearbers users can use the app to connect with their neighbors
        who live in the same building or housing complex.
        I want to build this app to narrow the distance between people and bring
        people together to create helpful and friendly social connections.
        I currently live in an apartment,
        I wish for a way to contact and connect with my neighbors.
    </p>

            <h3>Problem:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Have you ever felt far away from your neighbors even though you live in
                    the same building?
                <li>Have you ever deliberately avoided run-ins with your neighbors
                    in the hallway, elevator, or stairs?
                <li>Have you ever needed a neighbor's help,
                    or needed information about a power outage or internet outage,
                    but hesitated to knock on their door?
                <li>Have you ever thought about giving away your unwanted items
                    to people who need them?
                <li>Have you ever wanted to connect with your neighbors, but didn't know how？
                <li>New to a place and didn't know anyone?
            </ul>
            <h3>Solution:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a mobile application that can connects neighbors living
                    in the same building to create a supportive, friendly, and fun community.

    <h2>Primary Research</h2>
    <div class="spacer2"></div>
    <h3>User Surveys:</h3>
    <p>I canducted a user survey to determine if there is market for Nearbers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Through surveys, I found that only 10% of apartment dwellers know their
            neighbors. 90% of potential users do not know their neighbors.
        <li>10% of apartment dwellers don't want to connect with their neighbors,
            20% choose maybe,
            and the remaining 70% of people want to connect with their neighbors.

    <h3>User Interviews:</h3>
    <p>Key Insights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users want to get acquainted with their neighbors, but they don’t know how.
        <li>Users want to invite their neighbors to have brunch or drinks,
            but they are hesitated to knock on their doors.
        <li>Users have deliberately avoided running into their neighbors
            in the elevator because they don’t want small talk at that time.
        <li>Users want to share or give away some goods to neighbors who need them.
            They usually put things in the building lobby
            with a sign saying "Free! Please take."
        <li>Users are in interested in an app that lets them connect with your neighbors.
        <li>Sometimes a neighbor plays loud music late at night.
            Users want a nice way to ask their neighbor to be quiet,
            instead of pounding on the wall.

            <p>The left storyboard describes two situations how Nearbers
                can help users to support their neighbors.
            <ul>
                <li>In the first scenario, John wants to give away his old sofa.
                    Jacob just moved into his new apartment and wants to get some furniture.
                    Nearbers is a good platform for them to meet each other’s needs.
                <li>In the second scenario, John is working and his Internet
                    suddenly stops working.
                    He hesitates to knock on his neighor’s door
                    to ask if their Internet is also down.
                    John can use Nearbers to ask.
                    He can check on Nearbers,
                    post information or see if anyone else has a similar issue.
                    Jacob has mobile Hotspot, which can help
                    John's dilemma of needing to work and not having Internet.
