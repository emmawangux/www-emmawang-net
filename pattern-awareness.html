            increasing awareness and concern about the use of deceptive design techniques. But companies are
            increasingly using this design practices to trick consumers (FTC).

            <p class="general-paragraph">
              Even though deceptive patterns are unethical, they are commonly used on many platforms. Professor
              PattieBelle Hastings once mentioned that many designers don't seem aware they are using unethical design
              patterns unless they were taught at school. It is crucial to investigate the level of awareness and
              understanding of dark patterns among early students.

            <h3 class="padding-gap-top-24">Research Goal</h3>
            <p class="general-paragraph">
              The goal of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the awareness among design students and
              early-stage designers. The collected data is utilized to develop a tools that helps to raise awareness.

            <h3 class="padding-gap-top-24">Research Methods</h3>
            <p class="general-paragraph">
              There are 4 research methods are chosen to be used in this project - survey, interview, literature review,
              and content analysis. Survey was used to quantitative data, while interviews provide qualitative data.
              Additionally literature review and content analysis were employed to gain a deeper understanding and
              knowledge of the research topic.

              Deceptive patterns are unethical design practices that are widespread across various platforms. Many
              design students and experienced designers are not fully aware about these patterns. Raising awareness
              about this issue is crucial. Additionally, it's important to recognize that people generally prefer

              Users were confused by full-page pop-ups, unsure if they were part of an example or related to the
              website. This disrupted their understanding and navigation, causing frustration. To fix it, I added a
              browser frame to separate interactive sections and made the pop-up cover only those areas. This created
              clarity, allowing users to engage with the interactive sections without confusion.

            <h3>Outcome Discussion</h3>
            <p class="general-paragraph">
              The objective of the Pattern Awareness project is to raise awareness about deceptive patterns and promote
              ethical design practices among design students and early-stage designers. Throughout the design process, I
              designed a website that prioritized engagement, offering interactive features aim at helping users
              recognize and combat deceptive patterns. The design outcome is a website that features simple yet helpful
              interactive elements.
            </p>
            <h3 class="padding-gap-top-24">Seeking Input</h3>
            <p class="general-paragraph">
              Even thought it was a solo project, seeking input from peers was crucial. Engaging in collaborative
              discussions proved invaluable in refining ideas, making informed decisions, and strengthening the project.
              Collaboration leads to better outcomes.
            </p>

            <h3 class="padding-gap-top-24">Objective Clarity Through Deep Understanding</h3>
            <p class="general-paragraph">
              Another key takeaway from the project is the significance of fully understanding the topic before setting
              objectives. Initially, I faced uncertainty about the project's objective due to limited knowledge on this
              topic. This experience taught me the value of diving deep into the subject matter to gain clarity and
              ensure well-defined objectives.
            </p>

            <h3 class="padding-gap-top-24">Understanding More About Deceptive Patterns</h3>
            <p class="general-paragraph">
              Through an in-depth exploration of the subject matter, I gained a deeper understanding of deceptive
              patterns. By learning more about this topic, I can identify deceptive patterns in digital interfaces,
              enabling me to advocate for more ethical design practices in future projects.
