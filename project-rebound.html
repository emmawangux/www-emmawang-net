          <p class="general-paragraph">Project Rebound is a program that assists formerly incarcerated individuals in
            succeeding in higher education at California State Universities. I was a part of Aakash's lab at San
            Francisco State University, where
            I collaborated with team members on supporting digital literacy for returning citizens.</p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary-projects padding-gap-top-24">The Problem</h2>
          <p class="general-paragraph">In today's rapidly evolving job market, having digital skills is
            crucial. Yet, for returning citizens, there's an obstacle: <span class="bold">limited digital
              knowledge.</span> Not having digital skills makes it harder to succeed in college and to get job
            opportunities.</p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary-projects padding-gap-top-24">The Objective</h2>
          <p class="general-paragraph"> The goal of this project is to <span class="bold"> assist returning citizens in
              learning digital skills, thereby enhancing their success in college and expanding their job
              opportunities.</span></p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary-projects padding-gap-top-24">The Challenge</h2>

          <p class="general-paragraph">
            Helping returning citizens learn digital skills isn't clear and simple. Just having things like a
            Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) or a forum won't be enough to fix the issue.
            <span class="bold">How can we find the most appropriate solutions that address the specific needs and

          <h3>Research Method</h3>
          <p class="general-paragraph">
            In order to gain a clearer understanding of users' needs, we used qualitative methods - user interviews.
            This approach enabled us to engage in in-depth conversations and gain valuable insights.

            At an early stage, we interviewed 6 Project Rebound students to directly gather the
            students' perspectives, understand their challenges, and identify needs when it comes to technological
            issues.

            <p class="general-paragraph">
              Based on the initial research, we discovered that students had different levels of familiarity with
              technology.
              While some were comfortable searching for information online independently, <span class="bold">most
                struggled with technical terminology</span>. Another concern was that when staff members were
              unavailable, <span class="bold">students had few other people to ask for help</span>. As a result,
              providing
              support has been identified as the second priority. Therefore, we have prioritized the following problems:

            In today's fast-changing job market, having basic digital skills is vital, especially for those rejoining
            society after incarceration. Our project aims to close the digital gap and provide essential support to

          <p class="general-paragraph">
            Empathy with the user is a fundamental principle for UX designers. It is especially important in this
            project, as the user group has unique needs and challenges. To create a tool that assists them, it is
            essential to be a good listener and observer, deeply connecting with their pains and difficulties.
          </p>

          <h3 class="padding-gap-top-24">Insights That Informed Design Decisions</h3>
          <p class="general-paragraph">
            Insights are not a one-time affair, they continue to hold value throughout the design process. They act as
            a
            guiding compass, ensuring we stay on the right track. Regular reflection on these insights is crucial to
            assess whether the design effectively addresses the identified problems.
