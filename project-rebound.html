        <p class="general-paragraph">
          Each year, thousands of individuals are released from prisons, but they face higher unemployment rates

          Limited digital literacy due to resource constraints poses a challenge for formerly incarcerated citizens in

          accountability, assignments, and seeking assistance. They also face vulnerabilities to online scams.
          Insufficient support leads to low retention rates and employment struggles, hindering their successful
          re-integration into society.

        <div>
          <h3>Research Method</h3>
          <p class="general-paragraph">
            Used qualitative methods - interviews to gauge a better understanding of how we could support students in
            asking for help regarding technological issues.
          </p>

          <h4 class="heading-quaternary">
            Conducted interviews with Project Rebound students
          </h4>
          <p class="paragraph-quaternary">
            At an early stage, two teammates and I interviewed 6 Project Rebound students to directly gather the
            students' perspectives, understand their challenges, and identify needs when it comes to technological
            issues.
          </p>


          <h4 class="heading-quaternary">
            Conducted interviews with Project Rebound staff members
          </h4>
          <p class="paragraph-quaternary">
            We conducted individual interviews with 3 Project Rebound staff members to get their input on how to support
            students. Their experience working with students provided valuable knowledge about the challenges students
            face and the areas where they require support.
          </p>


          <h3 class="padding-gap-top-24">Research Goal</h3>
          <p class="general-paragraph">
            The primary goal of this study is to investigate Project Rebound students' use of technology and identify
            potential areas for improvement and support.
          </p>



          <h3 class="padding-gap-top-24">Analyzing Data - Interview Main Takeaways</h3>
          <p class="general-paragraph">
            Following the interviews, we summarized each interview, capturing the important points. From the summaries,
            we identified codes that formed the basis of our affinity diagram in Miro. Later, we organized each point to
            reveal relationships such as dependencies and sequences, which enabled us to identify themes.

          <h3>Outcome Discussion</h3>
          <p class="general-paragraph">
            In today's fast-changing job market, having basic digital skills is vital, especially for those rejoining
            society after incarceration. Our project aims to close the digital gap and provide essential support to each

          <p class="general-paragraph">
            Empathy with the user is a fundamental principle for UX designers. It is especially important in this
            project, as the user group has unique needs and challenges. To create a tool that assists them, it is
            essential to be a good listener and observer, deeply connecting with their pains and difficulties.
          </p>

          <h3 class="padding-gap-top-24">Insights That Informed Design Decisions</h3>
          <p class="general-paragraph">
            Insights are not a one-time affair, they continue to hold value throughout the design process. They act as a
            guiding compass, ensuring we stay on the right track. Regular reflection on these insights is crucial to
            assess whether the design effectively addresses the identified problems.
